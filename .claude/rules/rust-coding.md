# Rust Coding Conventions

## Module Structure

Single crate `symplectic` with modules:
- `geom::*` — polytope types, geometry primitives
- `algorithms::hk2017` — general capacity (exponential)
- `algorithms::billiard` — Lagrangian product capacity (fast)
- `algorithms::tube` — tube algorithm (placeholder)
- `kkt` — shared KKT solver (used by hk2017 and billiard)
- `constants` — shared tolerance constants
- `random` — random polytope generation
- `dataset` — dataset serialization

**When modifying shared modules** (kkt, constants): Check all callers. Use `cargo test --lib` to verify.

## Three Capacity Algorithms

| Module            | Applies to                        | Cost                    |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|
| algorithms::hk2017| All polytopes                     | Exponential in #facets  |
| algorithms::billiard| Lagrangian products only         | Fast                    |
| algorithms::tube  | No Lagrangian 2-faces             | Polynomial–exponential  |

Where domains overlap, algorithms must agree on the computed capacity.

## Coding Style

- Colocated tests: `foo.rs` has `foo_test.rs` in the same directory. Submodule tests use `#[path = "foo_test.rs"]`.
- A source file may have multiple test files (e.g. `foo_math_test.rs`, `foo_test.rs`)
- Prefer iterator chains over `for` loops. Minimize mutable state. Use `map`, `filter`, `flat_map`.
- Types encode mathematical invariants, validated at construction
- nalgebra for linear algebra, proptest for property-based testing
- **Coordinate convention**: (q₁, q₂, p₁, p₂) — components [0,1] = q-space (Lagrangian), [2,3] = p-space (Lagrangian), [0,2] = (q₁, p₁) symplectic plane, [1,3] = (q₂, p₂) symplectic plane. Defined in `geom/symplectic.rs`. Common mistake: assuming (q₁, p₁, q₂, p₂) ordering.
- **No rayon inside algorithms**: Parallelism is at the dataset level, not inside capacity algorithms.

## Thesis Constraints

Polytope4D: 5-16 facets typical. Research code, March 2026 deadline. Correctness > performance.

Don't suggest: Theoretical numerical analysis, O(n²) documentation when n ≤ 16, production features unlikely to matter.
Do suggest: Critical path tests, benchmarks for claims, robustness fixes.

## Invariant

`cargo test` passes from `crates/` with zero failures.
