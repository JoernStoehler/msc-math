# LaTeX Build and Review

## Build

```bash
cd thesis/ && latexmk && ./check-build.sh
```

`check-build.sh` parses the build log for overfull hboxes (> 1pt) and undefined references. It exits non-zero if any are found. **Agents must run this after every compilation** and fix any new warnings they introduced.

## Jörn Reviews PDF, Not .tex

Jörn reads the compiled PDF. He does not read `.tex` source files for review.

**When presenting content for Jörn's review:**
1. Compile the thesis (`cd thesis/ && latexmk`)
2. Look up the rendered number from `thesis/build/main.aux`
3. Tell Jörn: "Lemma 3.43 on page 25" — not "see rank-deficiency-dismissal.tex"

**When reporting edits:**
- Describe by rendered location: "the proof conclusion of Theorem 5.1"
- Not by source location: "line 418 of simple-minimizer-proof.tex"

**When referring to theorems/sections/equations in chat:**
- Use rendered numbers: "Theorem 5.3", "Section 2.1", "equation (3.7)"
- Not label names: `thm:simple-minimizer`, `sec:algorithm`
- How to get rendered numbers:
  ```bash
  grep 'label-name' thesis/build/main.aux
  ```

Note: In `.tex` source, always use `\ref{label}` — never hardcode numbers.

## Theorem/Section Numbers

Never guess — read from `thesis/build/main.aux` after building:
```bash
grep -E 'newlabel\{(sec:|thm:|lem:|def:|rem:|cor:)' thesis/build/main.aux
```

## Default Status

All content is **agent-written and unreviewed** unless explicitly marked otherwise. When a `.tex` file has no review markers, assume nothing has been verified by Jörn.
