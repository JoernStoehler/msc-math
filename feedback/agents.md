# Feedback: Agents (.claude/agents/)

Raw observations from agents about review/planning subagents. Do not analyze here — a future agent-design session will review and act on these.

## Format

Each entry: date, which agent, what happened, what was confusing/missing/unhelpful. Include: did the agent trigger when expected? Did it produce useful output?

## 2026-03-30: review-proof on verify-numerics/math.tex

Triggered proactively on first draft, found 11 issues (4 high: missing assumptions, broken \ref, handwavy "second-order" claim, dropped second-order term in runtime bound). All addressed before presenting to Jörn. Good ROI — saved one Jörn round-trip.

## 2026-04-01: opus subagent for QP algorithm research

Subagent confidently recommended vertex enumeration ("max of quadratic on polytope is at a vertex"). Self-corrected mid-analysis (indefinite H breaks this), but the main agent presented the recommendation before verifying applicability. Jörn caught it. **Lesson:** When a research subagent makes a mathematical claim, the main agent must verify it applies to the specific problem before presenting. Subagents don't know domain-specific constraints (our H is indefinite).

## 2026-04-01: review-formalization NOT used (should have been)

The claim "false negatives are caught by the capacity algorithm's sub-permutation enumeration" was stated confidently without checking the code. A review-formalization agent checking "does this statement correspond to what the capacity algorithm code does?" would have caught that the algorithm prunes permutations within subsets, so boundary optima aren't guaranteed to be found. **Lesson:** Use review-formalization proactively when making claims about code behavior, especially code outside the current experiment.
